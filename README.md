Fibonacci series - A series in which the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

Write a function such that given an integer N , it will generate and print the Fibonacci sequence up to Nth item.
Conditions: N > 0, Use recursion to obtain the results
e.g. Given N = 7, print out  1 1 2 3 5 8 13 ... 
Write a test to ensure that given N = 7, the sequence equals {1,1,2,3,5,8,13}
